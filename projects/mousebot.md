summary: "MouseBot was an algorithm that I made in AP Computer Sceince that would compete with other students."
---

The last AP Computer Science project my class was assigned was to create a mousebot. We each created an algorithm that would determine how our mousebot will traverse around an area that had similar characteristics to a maze that would be randomly generated. The goal was to survive the longest while up against other students using functions provided by our teacher and the difference.

From this experience, I learned about the challenges of having to deal with problems that aren’t fixed or set. I had to consider different strategies to not only out-think my fellow classmates, but to also consider the best possible paths to survive the longest. This also taught me how flexible programming is. There’s more than one way to accomplish something that could be more efficient.
