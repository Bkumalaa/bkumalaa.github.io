As I continue to learn more about software engineering, I have come across many challenges, from basic homework assignments to important projects or tests. In the future, these problems will escalate in terms of complexity and scalability. But why struggle and waste time on some issue that already has a solution?

## The Key to Success

This is where design patterns come in. Design patterns are reusable solutions to frequently occurring problems. They can be compared to blueprints or templates as they can help provide a general solution to numerous situations. This helps developers with efficiency, maintainability, and dealing with large-scale problems. 

## Using it Without Even Knowing

In terms of personal experience, I have yet to come across problems where I had to refer to using design patterns intentionally. However, a common assignment in my software engineering class was making landing pages. Every landing page was different in its way but had the same basic structure - header, navbar, body, and footer. Understanding this pattern was useful as the basic structure made both homework assignments and timed WODS easier to manage. 

## Outside of Computer Science

Although it is unlikely that I will pursue software engineering in the future, design patterns as a concept can be useful outside of just a computer science job. For instance, business occupations often require financial planning, such as budgeting methods. Overall, design patterns help make life simpler. Sometimes the best approach is to build on what works.
