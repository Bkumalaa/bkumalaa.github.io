## Introduction to ESLint 
VSCode is an open-source code editor I have used for various classes, from AP Computer Science in high school to 141 Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science in college. However, in Software Engineering, I was introduced to the numerous extensions you can download, including ESLint. ESLint helps to find and fix problems found in your code. This includes making sure that you are following the ‘coding standards”. For example, making sure that you have the right number of spaces to indent or making sure that there is a single newline at the end of your code. Failing to do so will cause your code to be flooded with those annoying, squiggly red lines. 

## A Stressful Lesson 
My first time using ESLint with VSCode was a very stressful one. When I was working on my first assignment, My code was full of red lines and I had no clue why. I first believed that something was wrong with my code, so I traced through each function and couldn’t piece together the issue. I thought that it could've been a missing parenthesis or bracket. Eventually, I realized that it was because of my spacing. Not only my indentation, but I was either missing a space or added a space that was not following the “coding standards”. This led to a very nerve-racking experience of fixing my spaces before the deadline which was in 30 minutes. 


Although my first experience with ESLint was not the best, I understand its usefulness. For one, having “coding standards” makes the readability of your code effortless, especially if you are working in a group, making the process of modifying and collaborating on the code easier. I hope that as I continue to use this extension, I will be able to get into the habit of coding in a more professional format.
